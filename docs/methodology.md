# Methodology

This section explores the implementation of CellGuard as a real-time crisis prediction and monitoring platform for sickle cell patients. The system integrates multiple vital sign measurements and clinical risk factors to provide early crisis detection. The primary objectives focus on three key aspects:

1. **Multi-Parameter Crisis Detection**: Implementation of a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks:
   - Vital signs (SpO2, temperature)
   - Dehydration levels
   - Age and gender-specific risk factors
   - Clinical risk scores derived from multiple parameters

2. **Real-time Risk Assessment Engine**: Development of a machine learning-based prediction system that:
   - Processes 26 derived features including:
     - Raw vital signs
     - Demographic risk factors
     - Clinical risk tiers
     - Feature interactions
     - Medical risk scores
   - Provides continuous probability estimates of crisis onset
   - Adapts thresholds based on individual patient profiles

3. **Clinical Decision Support**: Implementation of an intelligent alert system that:
   - Generates real-time recommendations based on vital sign patterns
   - Provides risk-stratified alerts (Low, Medium, High)
   - Suggests interventions based on dehydration levels and vital signs
   - Maintains emergency contact integration for critical situations

The system employs a web-based interface for real-time monitoring and a Flask backend for data processing and prediction. The architecture supports both global and user-specific prediction models, with the capability to personalize risk assessment based on individual patient history.
